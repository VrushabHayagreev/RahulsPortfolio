								<h2>An avid Data Science graduate and present-day Data Analyst actively striving to be a valuable contributor in the field of Data Science and Quantitative Analytics.</h2>
								<p>As a recent MS in Data Science graduate at Indiana University Bloomington, I am passionate about applying data-driven insights and solutions to real-world problems and opportunities. I have graduated in May 2023 with a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, statistics, and big data technologies. Currently, I work in the capacity of a Data Analyst in Caterpillar through Cintal Inc, where I am making use of my learnings and more in the field of Data Analytics, Data Visualization and Data Mining. I have also worked as a Reseach Assistant to professor Minkyung Koo of The University of New Mexico.
								</p>
								<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I was also a Student Supervisor at Indiana Memorial Union, where I manage the operations and staff of the dining services. This role has enhanced my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills, as well as my ability to handle complex and dynamic situations. Furthermore, I have completed two online courses in data analytics and neural networks, and have gained hands-on experience in analyzing soccer and football data as a freelance analyst. </p>
								<p>My core competencies include Python, SQL, R, Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, PostgreSQL, Hadoop, Spark, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, Neural Networks, Altair, and Vega-lite. I am actively looking for full-time opportunities as a data analyst, data scientist, quantitative analyst, or any related roles, where I can leverage my skills and knowledge to create value and impact. I am also eager to expand my network and connect with other professionals in the field of data science and quantitative analytics.</p>
